Eulerian Path:-    A path of edges that visits all the edges in graph exactly once (all non zero degree vertex must be connected).
                   Start vertex and end vertex has odd degeree and rest all vertex has even degree.
                   In directed graph for Starting node:-outdegree[node]-indegree[node]==1
                                         Ending node:-  indegree[node]-outdegree[node]==1
                                         Rest all node:-indegree[node]==outdegree[node]

Eulerian Circuit:- An Eulerian path that starts and ends at same node. 
                   all nodes have even degree(equal indegree and outdegree of each node in case of directed graph).

Semi-Eulerian Graph:- Eulerian Path but no Eulerian Circuit.

Eulerian Graph:-      Both Eulerian Path and Eulerian Circuit.

To check whether given graph has Eulerian path , Eulerian Circuit or none.
                1> isConnected() i.e all non zero degree node should belong to one component
                2> if noOfOddDegreeNode==2 =>Eulerian Path
                      noOfOddDegreeNode==0 =>Eulerian Circuit
                      else none
